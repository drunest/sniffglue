.SH NAME
sniffglue \- secure multithreaded packet sniffer

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sniffglue
[\fB\-vrpVh\fR]
[\fB\-n <threads>\fR]
.IR device

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B sniffglue
is a network sniffer written in rust. Network packets are parsed concurrently
using a thread pool to utilize all cpu cores. Project goals are that you can
run \fBsniffglue\fR securely on untrusted networks and that it must not crash
when processing packets. The output should be as useful as possible by default.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Increase filter sensitivity to show more (possibly less useful) packets.
The default only shows few packets, this flag can be specified multiple times. (maximum: 4)
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Prints help information
.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-promisc\fR
Set \fIdevice\fR to promiscuous mode
.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-read\fR
Open \fIdevice\fR as pcap file
.TP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-threads\fR \fIthreads\fR
Specify the number of threads
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Prints version information. If \fB\-r\fR was specified, open as pcap file
instead

.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
Sniff with default filters (dhcp, dns, tls, http) from \fIenp0s25\fR:
.RS
.nf
\fBsniffglue enp0s25\fP
.fi
.RE
.LP
Increase the filter sensitivity (arp):
.RS
.nf
\fBsniffglue -v enp0s25\fP
.fi
.RE
.LP
Increase the filter sensitivity (cjdns, ssdp, dropbox, packets with valid utf8)
.RS
.nf
\fBsniffglue -vv enp0s25\fP
.fi
.RE
.LP
Almost everything
.RS

Everything
.RS
.nf
\fBsniffglue -vvvv enp0s25\fP
.fi
.RE
.LP
Read a dump from \fIsniff.pcap\fR, with increased filter sensitivity and decode packets with 1 thread:

.nf
\fBsniffglue -vvrn1 sniff.pcap\fP
.fi

.SH SECURITY
To report a security issue please contact kpcyrd on ircs://irc.hackint.org.

.SS SECCOMP
.LP
To ensure a compromised process doesn't compromise the system, sniffglue uses
seccomp to restrict the syscalls that can be used after the process started.
This is done in two stages, first at the very beginning (directly after
env\_logger initialized) and once after the sniffer has been setup, but before
packets are read from the network.

.SS HARDENING
.LP
During the second stage, there's also some general hardening that is applied
before all unneeded syscalls are finally disabled. Those are system specific,
so a configuration file is read from \fB/etc/sniffglue.conf\fR. This config
file specifies an empty directory for \fBchroot\fR and an unprivileged account
in \fBuser\fR that is used to drop root privileges.

.SS FUZZING
.LP
The packet processing of \fBsniffglue\fR can be fuzzed using \fIcargo-fuzz\fR.
Everything you should need is provided in the \fIfuzz/\fR directory that is
distributed along with its source code. Please note that this program links
to \fIlibpcap\fR which is not included in the current fuzzing configuration.
